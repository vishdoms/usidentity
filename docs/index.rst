     <h2>Why Identity Verification Matters</h2>
     <p>
       In today’s digital age, online security is critical—especially when dealing with sensitive financial and personal information. USAA provides services to military personnel, veterans, and their families, and keeping accounts secure is a top priority. The identity verification process at <strong>usaa.com/verify</strong> ensures that access is granted only to the rightful account holder. This process also helps prevent fraud, identity theft, and unauthorized use of USAA’s services.
     </p>

     <p>
       Whether you are setting up a new USAA account, logging in from a new device, or updating your security settings, the verification system is designed to protect you. It uses a secure combination of login credentials, one-time verification codes, and personal information to confirm your identity.
     </p>

     <h2>Step-by-Step: How to Verify Your Identity</h2>
     <p>Follow the steps below to complete your identity verification:</p>
     <ol>
       <li>Open a browser on your device (desktop or mobile) and go to <strong>https://www.usaa.com/verify</strong>.</li>
       <li>Log in with your USAA username and password.</li>
       <li>You may be asked to enter a one-time verification code sent to your registered mobile number or email address.</li>
       <li>Enter the code on the website and click "Continue."</li>
       <li>If prompted, answer any security questions or confirm details such as your mailing address or last transaction.</li>
       <li>Once verification is complete, you will be redirected to your account dashboard where you can manage your services.</li>
     </ol>

     <p>
       If you have trouble receiving the code or completing any step, USAA offers support through live chat, phone, and the mobile app. You can also request the code be sent again or choose an alternate method.
     </p>

     <h2>Best Practices for Secure Verification</h2>
     <p>
       Always make sure you are accessing a secure website. Look for the HTTPS lock icon in your browser’s address bar and double-check that the URL is spelled correctly. Never click on suspicious or unsolicited links claiming to be from USAA.
     </p>

     <p>
       USAA will never ask for your password or full Social Security number in an email or over the phone. If you receive such a request, it could be a phishing attempt. In such cases, report the activity to USAA immediately.
     </p>

     <p>
       To stay protected, regularly update your password, enable multi-factor authentication, and review your account activity for any unauthorized actions.
     </p>

     <p>
       In summary, using <strong>usaa.com/verify</strong> is a quick, secure way to confirm your identity and access your USAA services with peace of mind. Take a few minutes today to complete your verification and strengthen the safety of your account.
